			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I have a master degree in data science and plan to pursue a master degree in computer science. With over two years of experience
				in Python, SQL, and R, it's easier for me to choose switch to different languages based on different situations. And I'm familiar 
				with a lot of visualisation tools like Power BI, Tableau, R Shiny, and Python Flask/Django. Also, I know a lot of data science tools 
				like AWS, Docker, Google Cloud API, etc. Having solid knowledge in data modeling, it's easier for me to deploy Python scikit-learn 
				and Keras/PyTorch to solve unsupervised and supervised problems as well as natural language processing problems. I'm very passinate about
				helping people use their data wisely and efficiently and boost their business by feeding insightful information.
